Hotel Management System: A C++ Project
Computer Science Department, University of Gondar
Year: 2023/2024

This project, titled Hotel Management System, was developed in the Computer Science Department at the University of Gondar as part of the academic curriculum in 2023/2024. Written in C++, this project integrates data structures and algorithms to create an efficient and functional system for managing hotel operations.

The Hotel Management System is designed to streamline various tasks within the hotel environment, including:

Guest Management: Handling guest check-in and check-out processes, tracking room availability, and maintaining detailed guest records.
Room Management: Managing the inventory of available rooms, booking statuses, and room categories, from standard rooms to luxury suites.
Billing and Payments: Generating bills based on guest stays, services availed, and managing various payment options for a seamless financial process.
Service Management: Tracking additional hotel services such as room service, laundry, and other amenities, ensuring proper billing and resource allocation.
Key Features and Concepts Implemented:
Data Structures:

Linked Lists and Arrays: For managing guest records and room availability.
Stacks and Queues: To handle guest service requests and manage check-ins and check-outs.
Trees and Hash Tables: For quick lookups of guest information and room statuses, ensuring efficient data retrieval and storage.
Algorithms:

Sorting Algorithms: Used to keep room bookings and guest records organized for faster access.
Search Algorithms: Implemented to find available rooms or specific guest information in real time.
Graph Algorithms: Applied to model and manage complex hotel service networks.
